# Multiple Linear Regression

This repository contains an example of Multiple Linear Regression, a widely used regression analysis technique in statistics and machine learning.

## Overview

Multiple Linear Regression aims to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. The basic mathematical formula for Multiple Linear Regression is:

\[ Y = b_0 + b_1 \cdot X_1 + b_2 \cdot X_2 + \ldots + b_n \cdot X_n + \varepsilon \]

- \( Y \): Dependent variable
- \( b_0 \): Intercept term
- \( b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \): Regression coefficients
- \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \): Independent variables
- \( \varepsilon \): Error term

## Key Concepts

- **Multiple Independent Variables:** The model includes multiple independent variables, each representing its own impact on the dependent variable.
- **Intercept Term:** \( b_0 \) coefficient represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero.
- **Regression Coefficients:** \( b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \) coefficients determine the effect of each independent variable. Positive coefficients indicate an increase in the dependent variable with an increase in the corresponding independent variable, and vice versa.
- **Model Fit and Error Term:** The model creates an estimated value for the dependent variable based on combinations of independent variables. The error term (\( \varepsilon \)) represents real-world complexities and uncertainties in the model.
