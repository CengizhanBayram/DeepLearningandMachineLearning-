# Polynomial Regression

Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis used when the relationship between the independent variable (predictor) and dependent variable (response) is non-linear. While linear regression fits a straight line to the data, polynomial regression fits a polynomial curve (such as quadratic, cubic, etc.) to better capture the non-linear relationship between the variables.

In polynomial regression, the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an n-th degree polynomial function:

y = β0 + β1x + β2x^2 + ... + βnx^n + ε

Here:
- y is the dependent variable (response).
- x is the independent variable (predictor).
- β0, β1, ..., βn are the coefficients of the polynomial terms.
- n is the degree of the polynomial.
- ε is the error term.

The goal of polynomial regression is to estimate the coefficients β0, β1, ..., βn that minimize the sum of squared errors between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable.

Polynomial regression allows for more flexibility in modeling complex relationships between variables compared to linear regression. However, it's important to note that higher-degree polynomial models can be prone to overfitting, where the model fits the noise in the data rather than the underlying trend. Therefore, it's essential to choose an appropriate degree for the polynomial based on the data and the problem at hand. Regularization techniques such as ridge or lasso regression can also be applied to mitigate overfitting in polynomial regression.
